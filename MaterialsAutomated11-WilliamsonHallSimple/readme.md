# Williamson-Hall Analysis
This code allows for the automated analysis of PXRD to perform Williamson Hall analysis for the extraction of crystal strain and size.
As this does not correct for instrumental contributions, such analysis is better used for comparative analysis. One could if needed using a standard correct down the line for this however
For best use, a simulated pattern generated using Vesta should be uploaded to compare your data to the experimental, as this assists with finding peak locations.
