# Interpolating Magnetization Data for Magnetocaloric Effect Calculations
This code takes magnetizaton data (magnetization as a function of temperature and applied field) and interpolates the data using scipy.interpolate. 
An application of such an interpolation is the calculation of the magnetic entropy change:

The integration of the magnetization data requires a large amount of measurements, which can be time consuming. Thus interpolated data can help reduce the amount of measurement time needed to determine this value.
